# School District Analysis
Performing an analysis using school and student data to inform a school district on their budget and priorities.  

A list of data included each school's number of students and budget, which was combined to another set of detailed data of each student's reading and math scores. From this, we have analyzed the math and reading scores based on grades for each school, as well as budget usage for different groups, and scores by school size but we will focus on highlighting two major conclusions drawn from this.
